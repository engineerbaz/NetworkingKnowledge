# IPv6 is inevitable for Next-generation technologies 5G, IoT, Cloud

IPv6 was introduced 24 years ago with a huge space of addresses and Carrier-grade NAT temporarily eases the shortage of IPv4 till now.
But the need for adopting IPv6 is inevitable now, due to

- The exponential growth of the Internet & development of 3G/4G/5G  mobile & broadband technologies.
- Increased address space for IoT, Smart City/home
- Need for better support for real-time delivery of data
- Need for simpler autoconfiguration and renumbering

## Next-generation technologies

Technologies of the new era are bound to have IPv6 due to the massive requirements of addresses and availability of the internet to PCs, wireless IP phones, set-top boxes (STBs), video devices, and security monitoring devices and specially zillion of IoT end devices. 

### IoT (Internet of Things)
IoT is the network of physical objects—devices embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity—that enables these objects to collect and exchange data.`

It is predicted that by 2022, 29 Billion devices will be on the internet. Thats all due to IoT

### 5G (5th Mobile Generation)
5G is the next generation of mobile internet connectivity, offering faster speeds and more reliable connections
5G initially used a super high-frequency spectrum, which has a shorter range but higher capacity, to deliver a massive pipe for online access. 

#### 5G requirements
- 10Gbps connections to end points in the field  
- 1 millisecond end-to-end round trip delay (latency) 
- 1000x bandwidth per unit area
- 10-100x number of connected devices 
- 99.999 percent availability 
- 100 percent coverage
- 90 percent reduction in network energy usage

### Cloud
    Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power.
As we all know, Cloud computing is one of the most propitious technology that revamped the whole world.

</br>
As per Forbes, 32% of IT’s budgets will be dedicated to the Cloud by 2021 

- Reachability of Private, Public & Hybrid Clouds
- Bandwidth & Global Connectivity
- Communication Between Microservices
- IP networks to handle the cloud’s massive data load
- A Scalable Topology

## Co-relation of Technologies & IP Network

Corelation

- 5G uses CloudRAN & Cloud Core
- IoT uses 5G
- BigData Analysis is a must for better output of IoT data
- AI’s deep learning will help data from BD
- THE FUTURE OF IoT IS AI -- AI-focused IoT start-ups are on the rise.
- Inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) can improve the performance of routing protocols - implement an intelligent routing protocol in a SDN topology
- IoT may use Cloud services, AI works with Big Data analysis for better output.

##### The need for using IP version 6 is imminent. (We can discuss IPv6 in some other blog too!)
